{% include captioned-image.html image="arianna/biosymp24_card.png" caption="I presented this work at the JABSOM Biosymposium in Spring 2024. This slide is describing the motivation behind the work, which is to enable exploration of body shape and texture features in PCA-space. Fiducial points need to be placed for existing methods to be used, but placing the points is labor-intensive, limiting the size of the dataset we can do this analysis on." %}

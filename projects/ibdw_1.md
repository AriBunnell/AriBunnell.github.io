{% include captioned-image.html image="arianna/Slide1.SVG" caption="This work was done in collaboration with Dr. Lambert Leong. I presented this work in an oral presentation during the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment and Modeling session of the 10th International Breast Density Workshop in Kailua-Kona, which is co-chaired by my PhD co-advisor, Dr. John Shepherd. In this work we showed that deep radiomic features extracted from mammograms contain advanced cancer risk information not captured by age-adjusted BI-RADS breast density alone." %}

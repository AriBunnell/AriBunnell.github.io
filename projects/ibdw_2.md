{% include captioned-image.html image="arianna/poster_5_24_PS.svg" caption="I presented this work in an oral presentation during the Methods of Density and Risk session of the 10th International Breast Density Workshop in Kailua-Kona, which is co-chaired by my PhD co-advisor, Dr. John Shepherd. In this work we used that AI-assigned BI-RADS mammographic breast density (from the Geras NYU algorithm) can be predicted from diagnostic breast ultrasound imaging." %}

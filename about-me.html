    <h1 class="display-4">About me</h1>

    <p>I am studying for my Ph.D. in Computer Science in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I'm co-advised by <a href="https://peterjsadowski.github.io/">Dr. Peter Sadowski</a> in the Information and Computer Sciences Department and <a href="https://www.uhcancercenter.org/shepherd-john">Dr. John Shepherd</a> in the Population Sciences in the Pacific (Cancer Epidemiology) Program at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center</p>

    <p>Much of my current research is focused on developing portable, accessible, AI-empowered breast cancer screening and risk assessment solutions for the outer Pacific Islands, where breast cancer screening programs are small or nonexistent. With AI integrated into portable breast ultrasound, we can enable local healthcare workers to image women in their community and provide breast cancer diagnoses and risk information to outlying commnunities. The development of this project is housed under the <a href = "https://shepherdresearchlab.org/makawalu-study-breast-cancer-screening/">Makawalu Project</a> in the <a href = "https://shepherdresearchlab.org/">Shepherd Research Lab. </a></p>
  
    <p>I'm also privileged to work in a variety of problems applying AI to other medical imaging modalities (including DXA, mammography, and histology imaging) as a member of the <a href="https://aiphi.shepherdresearchlab.org/">Artificial Intelligence Precision Health Institute</a> at the University of Hawaii and as a member of the <a href = "https://peterjsadowski.github.io/group/">Sadowski Machine Learning Lab.</a></p>

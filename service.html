    <h1 class="display-4">Community Service</h1>

    <p>I am deeply passionate about community service and giving back. I give my time to organizations which I believe in, traditionally in advancement of underrepresented groups, or in food insecurity. I have benefited from access to food pantries, support groups for women in STEM, and the generosity of scholars taking a chance on me throughout my life. I hope to pay it forward through donating my time and expertise to these organizations. </p>

    <h5 class="display-4" style="font-size: 24px;">Graduate Women in Science Hawaii</h5>
    <p>With the Graduate Women in Science Hawaii (GWISH), I have previously served (2023-2024) as the Professional Development Coordinator, where my role was to organize events which our members (post-baccalaureate women in STEM in Hawaii, including professors, graduate students, lab technicians, and others!) can use to develop pertinent skills for academia and beyond. <strong>I currently serve as the president of GWISH. </strong> Learn more about GWISH, our mission and our events <a href="https://www.gwishawaii.org/">here</a>. </p>
    
    <h5 class="display-4" style="font-size: 24px;">Science Mentorship Institute</h5>
    <p>With the Science Mentorship Institute (sci-MI), I volunteered as the Computer Science Mentorship Program Director from 2023-24. I built up the computer science mentorship program and ran the inaugural iteration of the summer program. The mission of sci-MI is to expose high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds to scientific research, in the hopes that they continue to pursue STEM in college and beyond. I have also served as a mentor, content developer, and administrative help for sci-MI, for both the neuroscience and computer science mentorship programs from 2022-onwards.

    <h5 class="display-4" style="font-size: 24px;">Student Nutrition and Access Center</h5>
    <p>With the Student Nutrition and Access Center (SNAC) at Utah State University, I volunteered as a data analytics consultant. We (myself and <a href="https://ethanhartley22.github.io/">Ethan Hartley</a>) computed demographic descriptive statistics, propensity scores, and performed economic analysis to demonstrate the worth the SNAC pantry added to the Utah State community. Our report resulted in a permanent, funded position being created to oversee the SNAC pantry, instead of purely relying on student volunteerism for remaining open.
